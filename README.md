# Weight Plate Calculator
This is a personal program I built for my home workouts to help me calculate weight needed for my lifts. The program allows you to select a workout from a combobox, enter a weight and calculate the weights needed. There is an option to send an email that can be used to email another person or send an SMS by emailing your cellphone number's email address.
<br>To use this program, you'll need the Javax.jar library. You may need to configure some of the options for your home gym setup e.g. workouts, plate sizes and amounts or units since this program is written for pounds (lbs).
